## Data Structure Used

- We used a array list of type Restaurants, which will hold the list of all the Restaurants created.
## Summary

This project performs the task managing a **list of restaurants** with their speicific details.
We also used **Validation** in this project on a attribute of Restaurant named **restroID**, this Validation is called **NotBlank** which will make sure the restroID entered at time of creating a Restaurant is not blank and has some value provided in it.
We used **MVC Architecture** to create this project. 
And this is created in **SpringBoot** using **Maven** and **Java**.
